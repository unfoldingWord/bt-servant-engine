# bt-servant-engine

An AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for Bible translators, now powered by **Meta's Cloud API** (no more Twilio!). The assistant uses FastAPI, OpenAI, and ChromaDB to answer Bible translation questions in multiple languages.

---
## How the Decision Graph Works (brain.py)
The decision graph below defines the flow of a Bible translation assistant that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to respond to user messages intelligently and faithfully. Each node represents a distinct step in the processing pipeline, and transitions between them are determined either linearly or conditionally based on user input and system state.

**Nodes making LLM API calls*

*Grey boxes represent current user 'Intents'*

## Node Summaries
- **start_node:** Detects if its the first interaction with the user and, if so, adds welcome information to the list of responses passed through the graph.
- **determine_query_language_node:** Detects the language of the user's message to support multilingual responses and select the appropriate document collection.
- **preprocess_user_query_node:** Clarifies the user's message using past conversation context, correcting ambiguity and minor issues while preserving intent.
- **determine_intents_node:** Classifies the user's message into one or more predefined intents (see below).
- **set_response_language_node:** Updates the user's preferred response language in persistent storage.
- **query_vector_db_node:** Searches relevant ChromaDB document collections using the transformed query, applying a relevance filter to determine if results are useful.
- **query_open_ai_node:** Uses OpenAI (with context from Chroma DB RAG results and chat history) to generate a response. Conditional logic routes long responses to chunking (splitting responses to sizes acceptable by Meta).
- **chunk_message_node:** If the assistant's response exceeds the 1500-character limit imposed by WhatsApp, this node semantically chunks the message into smaller parts.
- **translate_responses_node:** Translates the assistant's final output into the user’s preferred language, if needed. If more than one intent was processed, this node also consolidates responses into one cohesive message.
- **handle_unsupported_function_node:** Informs the user that a requested function is not supported and lists what the system can do.
- **handle_system_information_request_node:** Answers questions about the assistant itself (what it can do, how it works, resources). Uses a dedicated system prompt and help docs.
- **converse_with_bt_servant_node:** Handles general conversation with the user (e.g., "what's up?").
- **get_passage_summary_node / get_passage_keywords_node / get_translation_helps_node:** Passage-specific capabilities (see features below).
- **retrieve_scripture_node / listen_to_scripture_node / translate_scripture_node:** Scripture retrieval, audio, and translation workflows.

## How intents are determined and processed
The assistant uses a dedicated node (determine_intents_node) to classify the user’s message into one or more high-level intents, which are used to determine the next step in the assistant’s response pipeline. This node relies on the OpenAI model (gpt-4o) to parse the message in context. It sends the following structured input to the model:

- The current user message (already preprocessed and clarified). 
- Chat history (max five turns back), if available, so the model can detect intent based on prior interactions.

The model receives a tightly constrained system prompt instructing it to always return one or more intents, using a fixed enumeration. The model’s response is parsed (by the LLM) into a list of valid IntentType enum values. If multiple intents are encountered, the graph (Langgraph) later processes them *in parallel*, and a later node aggregates the responses into a single cohesive response.

## Capabilities (What it can do)
1) Summarize a passage (e.g., "Summarize Titus 1"; "Summarize Mark 1:1–8")
2) Translation helps — point out typical translation challenges (e.g., "Translation challenges for John 1:1?")
3) Keywords — list key terms in a passage (e.g., "Important words in Romans 1")
4) Show scripture text (e.g., "John 3:16–18")
5) Read aloud — hear the passage as audio (e.g., "Read Romans 8:1–4 aloud")
6) Translate scripture (e.g., "Translate John 3:16 into Indonesian")
7) Set response language (e.g., "Set my response language to Spanish")

## Current Supported User Intents
- get-bible-translation-assistance
- get-passage-summary
- get-passage-keywords
- get-translation-helps
- retrieve-scripture
- listen-to-scripture
- translate-scripture
- set-response-language
- perform-unsupported-function
- retrieve-system-information
- converse-with-bt-servant

## How Intents Drive the Decision Graph
The extracted intent(s) are used by the function process_intents(state) to conditionally branch to the appropriate node in the LangGraph. If multiple intents were detected, they are processed in parallel (using Langgraph's fan-out/fan-in paradigm/functionality). Here’s how different intents affect the flow:
- **get-bible-translation-assistance** → Routes to `query_vector_db_node`, which kicks off the full RAG pipeline.
- **set-response-language** → Routes to `set_response_language_node`, which updates the user’s language preference and skips retrieval/generation.
- **retrieve-system-information** → Routes to `handle_system_information_request_node`, which uses help docs and a special system prompt to answer.
- **perform-unsupported-function** → Routes to `handle_unsupported_function_node`, a graceful fallback that informs the user the function isn't supported and lists supported features.
- **converse-with-bt-servant** → Routes to `converse_with_bt_servant_node`, where a conversational response is added to the list of responses being gathered.
- **get-passage-summary / get-passage-keywords / get-translation-helps** → Routes to the corresponding handler nodes to operate on the requested passage.
- **retrieve-scripture / listen-to-scripture / translate-scripture** → Routes to scripture retrieval/audio/translation nodes.

## Pricing Defaults

- The engine computes token and cost totals in its performance reports. By default, it includes pricing for `gpt-4o` and voice flows (`gpt-4o-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-tts`) if no environment override is provided.

```
OPENAI_PRICING_JSON='{"gpt-4o": {"input_per_million": 2.5, "output_per_million": 10.0, "cached_input": 1.25}, "gpt-4o-transcribe": {"input_per_million": 2.5, "output_per_million": 10.0, "audio_input_per_million": 6.0}, "gpt-4o-mini-tts": {"input_per_million": 0.6, "audio_output_per_million": 12.0}}'
```

- To override (e.g., if pricing changes), set `OPENAI_PRICING_JSON` in your environment or `.env` to a JSON object mapping model names to per‑million rates. Recognized keys per model:
  - `input_per_million`, `output_per_million` (text tokens)
  - `cached_input` or `cached_input_per_million` (optional discounted text input)
  - `audio_input_per_million`, `audio_output_per_million` (audio tokens)

- Notes:
  - Extra keys are optional; when provided and the SDK reports corresponding token counts, those costs are included.
  - Explicit env values always override the built-in default.


## Webhook Setup

Set your webhook URL in the [Meta Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/) under your WhatsApp App configuration:

- **Callback URL**: `https://<your-domain>/meta-whatsapp`
- **Verify Token**: Must match `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` in your `.env`

---

## Testing Locally

You can test message flow locally using tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose `localhost:8000` to the public internet, then set your webhook in Meta to use the `https://<ngrok-url>/meta-whatsapp` endpoint.

---

## Chroma API Endpoints

These endpoints manage and inspect ChromaDB collections used by the assistant. When `ENABLE_ADMIN_AUTH=True`, include an admin token via either `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Admin-Token: <token>`.

- `GET /chroma/collections`: List all collection names.
- `POST /chroma/collections` body: `{ "name": "<collection>" }`: Create a collection.
- `DELETE /chroma/collections/{name}`: Delete a collection.
- `GET /chroma/collections/{name}/count`: Return document count in a collection.
- `GET /chroma/collection/{name}/ids`: Return all document IDs in a collection.
- `DELETE /chroma/collections/{name}/documents/{document_id}`: Delete a specific document.
- `POST /chroma/collections/{dest}/merge`: Start a background merge of one collection into another.
- `GET /chroma/merge-tasks/{task_id}`: Get status of a merge task.
- `DELETE /chroma/merge-tasks/{task_id}`: Cancel a merge task (best-effort).
- `POST /chroma/add-document` (alias: `POST /add-document`) body:
  `{ "document_id": "<id>", "collection": "<name>", "name": "<doc name>", "text": "...", "metadata": { ... } }`

Example: fetch document IDs for a collection

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/chroma/collection/uw_translation_notes/ids | jq .
```

Response

```json
{
  "collection": "uw_translation_notes",
  "count": 67819,
  "ids": ["tn_ACT_vcsw", "..."]
}
```

### Merge collections

Start a merge with dry-run to preview duplicates and plan:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/chroma/collections/dest/merge \
  -d '{
        "source": "src",
        "on_duplicate": "fail",
        "dry_run": true,
        "duplicates_preview_limit": 100
      }' | jq .
```

Run a merge that creates unified numeric IDs in the dest, with modest throttling and default re-embed:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/chroma/collections/dest/merge \
  -d '{
        "source": "src",
        "mode": "copy",
        "create_new_id": true,
        "batch_size": 1000,
        "sleep_between_batches_ms": 100
      }' | jq .
```

Faster copy that reuses source embeddings (dimensions must match), skipping duplicates:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/chroma/collections/dest/merge \
  -d '{
        "source": "src",
        "use_source_embeddings": true,
        "on_duplicate": "skip"
      }' | jq .
```

Poll or cancel a running merge task:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/chroma/merge-tasks/<task_id> | jq .
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_TOKEN" -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/chroma/merge-tasks/<task_id> | jq .
```

Status response includes progress and ETA metrics:

```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "source": "src",
  "dest": "dest",
  "status": "running",
  "total": 12345,
  "completed": 2100,
  "skipped": 0,
  "overwritten": 0,
  "deleted_from_source": 0,
  "docs_per_second": 85.2,
  "eta_seconds": 120.5,
  "eta_at": 1736455123.42
}
```
\- `docs_per_second` is an average since the task started.
\- `eta_seconds` and `eta_at` are estimates; values may fluctuate as batches complete.
