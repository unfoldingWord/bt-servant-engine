# bt-servant-engine

An AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for Bible translators, now powered by **Meta's Cloud API** (no more Twilio!). The assistant uses FastAPI, OpenAI, and ChromaDB to answer Bible translation questions in multiple languages.

## How the Decision Graph Works (brain.py)
The decision graph below defines the flow of a Bible translation assistant that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to respond to user messages intelligently and faithfully. Each node represents a distinct step in the processing pipeline, and transitions between them are determined either linearly or conditionally based on user input and system state.

## Node Summaries
- **start_node:** Detects if its the first interaction with the user and, if so, adds welcome information to the list of responses passed through the graph.
- **determine_query_language_node:** Detects the language of the user's message to support multilingual responses and select the appropriate document collection. 
- **preprocess_user_query_node:** Clarifies the user's message using past conversation context, correcting ambiguity and minor issues while preserving intent.
- **determine_intents_node:** Classifies the user's message into one or more predefined intents: get-bible-translation-assistance, perform-unsupported-function, retrieve-system-information, set-response-language, or converse-with-bt-servant.  
- **set_response_language_node:** Updates the user's preferred response language in persistent storage.
- **query_db_node:** Searches relevant ChromaDB document collections using the transformed query, applying a relevance filter to determine if results are useful.
- **query_open_ai_node:** Uses OpenAI (with context from Chroma DB RAG results and chat history) to generate a response. Conditional logic routes long responses to chunking (splitting responses to sizes acceptable by Meta).
- **chunk_message_node:** If the assistant's response exceeds the 1500-character limit imposed by WhatsApp, this node semantically chunks the message into smaller parts.
- **translate_responses_node:** Translates the assistant's final output into the user’s preferred language, if needed. If more than one intent was processed, this node also makes a call resulting in the consolidation of all the responses into one message.
- **handle_unsupported_function_node:** Inform the user that the requested function is not supported and let the user know what the system actually can do.
- **handle_system_information_request_node:** This node handles user questions about the assistant itself — such as what it can do, how it works, or what resources it uses. When this intent is detected, the system loads a predefined system prompt that frames the assistant as a helpful RAG-based servant to Bible translators. The assistant uses this context to generate a response strictly limited to the help docs.
- **converse_with_bt_servant_node:** This node handles general conversation with the user, like when the user simply says "what's up?!"

## How intents are determined and processed
The assistant uses a dedicated node (determine_intents_node) to classify the user’s message into one or more high-level intents, which are used to determine the next step in the assistant’s response pipeline. This node relies on the OpenAI model (gpt-4o) to parse the message in context. It sends the following structured input to the model:

- The current user message (already preprocessed and clarified). 
- Chat history (max five turns back), if available, so the model can detect intent based on prior interactions.

The model receives a tightly constrained system prompt instructing it to always return one or more intents, using a fixed enumeration. The model’s response is parsed (by the LLM) into a list of valid IntentType enum values. If multiple intents are encountered, the graph (Langgraph) later processes them *in parallel*, and a later node aggregates the responses into a single cohesive response.

## Current Supported User Intents
- get-bible-translation-assistance (all questions about the bible, bible translation, etc. Example: "Summarize Titus 2.")
- perform-unsupported-function (some attempt to invoke non-existent functionality. Example: "Teach me how to play football")
- retrieve-system-information (an attempt to learn about the system or receive help to do something. Example: "Help!")
- specify-response-language (an attempt to set the response language. Example: "Set my response language to English")
- converse-with-bt-servant (an attempt to engage in normal conversation with the bot. Example: "What's up BT Servant?!")

## How Intents Drive the Decision Graph
The extracted intent(s) are used by the function process_intents(state) to conditionally branch to the appropriate node in the LangGraph. If multiple intents were detected, they are processed in parallel (using Langgraph's fan-out/fan-in paradigm/functionality). Here’s how different intents affect the flow:
- **get-bible-translation-assistance** → Route to query_db_node, which kicks off the full RAG pipeline.
- **set-response-language** → Routes to set_response_language_node, which updates the user’s language preference and skips retrieval/generation. 
- **retrieve-system-information** → Routes to handle_system_information_request_node, which uses help docs and a special system prompt to answer.
- **perform-unsupported-function** → Routes to handle_unsupported_function_node, a graceful fallback that informs the user the function isn't supported, and provides information detailing what the system can do.
- **converse-with-bt-servant** → Routes to converse_with_bt_servant_node, where a conversational response is added to the list of responses being gathered. 

## Environment Setup

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.12+

This app uses a `.env` file for local development.

### Step-by-Step Setup (Local)

1. **Create a `.env` file**

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

2. **Edit your `.env`**

Fill in the required values:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-verify-token-here
META_WHATSAPP_TOKEN=your-meta-access-token-here
META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-meta-phone-number-id
BASE_URL=https://your.public.domain
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_IJ...
```

> All five above variables are required for the Meta Cloud API to work properly.

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
uvicorn bt_servant:app --reload
```

## Webhook Setup

Set your webhook URL in the [Meta Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/) under your WhatsApp App configuration:

- **Callback URL**: `https://<your-domain>/meta-whatsapp`
- **Verify Token**: Must match `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` in your `.env`

---

## Testing Locally

You can test message flow locally using tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose `localhost:8000` to the public internet, then set your webhook in Meta to use the `https://<ngrok-url>/meta-whatsapp` endpoint.
