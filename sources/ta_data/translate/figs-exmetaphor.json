  "text": "An **extended metaphor** is an explicit metaphor that uses multiple images and multiple ideas at the same time. This is in contrast to a [simple metaphor](../figs-simetaphor/01.md), which uses only a single Image and a single Idea. The difference between an extended metaphor and a [complex metaphor](../figs-cometaphor/01.md) is that an extended metaphor is explicitly stated by a writer/speaker, but a complex metaphor is not.\n\n### Explanation of an Extended Metaphor\n\nWhen using a metaphor, a writer/speaker uses a physical Image in order to express an abstract Idea about some immediate Topic, with at least one point of comparison between the Topic and the Image. In an extended metaphor, the writer/speaker explicitly states the Topic, and then describes multiple images and communicates multiple ideas.\n\nIn Isaiah 5:1b-7, the prophet Isaiah uses a vineyard (the **Image**) to express God’s disappointment (the **Idea**) with the nation of Israel (the **Topic**) for their unfaithfulness to God and his covenant with them as his people. Farmers care for their gardens, and a farmer would feel disappointed if his vineyard produced bad fruit. If a vineyard produced only bad fruit for a long enough time, the farmer would eventually stop caring for it. We call this an extended metaphor because the prophet describes in detail multiple images relating to a vineyard as well as multiple aspects of God’s disappointment.\n\n> 1b My well beloved had a **vineyard** on a very fertile hill. 2 He **spaded it,** **removed the stones**, and **planted it** with an excellent kind of vine. He **built a tower** in the middle of it, and also **built a winepress**. **He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes**. 3 So now, inhabitant of Jerusalem and man of Judah; judge between me and my vineyard. 4 What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it? **When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes**? 5 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge; I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down. 6 I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. Instead, briers and thorns will spring up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it. 7 For **the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel**, and the man of Judah his pleasant planting; **he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing**; **for righteousness, but, instead, a shout for help**. (Isa 5:1b-7 ULT)\n\n### Other Examples From the Bible\n\nIn Psalm 23, the psalmist uses the physical **Image** of a shepherd to describe the way that God (the **Topic**) shows great concern and care (the **Idea**) for his people. The psalmist describes multiple aspects of what shepherds do for sheep (leads them to pasture and to water, protects them, etc.). The psalmist also describes multiple aspects of how God takes care of him (gives him life, righteousness, comfort, etc.). Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. What God does for his people is like these actions.\n\n> 1 Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.  \n> 2 He **makes me** to lie down in green pastures;  \n> he **leads me** beside tranquil water.  \n> 3 He **brings back** my life;  \n> he **guides me** along right paths for his name’s sake.  \n> 4 Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,  \n> I will not fear harm since you are with me;  \n> your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4 ULT)\n\n#### Reasons This Is a Translation Issue\n\n* People may not realize that the images represent other things.\n* People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images.\n* Extended metaphors are often so profound that it would be impossible for a translator to show all of the meaning generated by the metaphor.\n\n### Translation Principles\n\n* Make the meaning of the extended metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.\n* Do not make the meaning more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.\n* When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.\n* If the target audience is not familiar with some of the images, you will need to find some way of helping them understand the images so that they can understand the whole extended metaphor.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nConsider using the same extended metaphor if your readers will understand it in the same way the original readers would have understood it. If not, here are some other strategies:\n\n(1) If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, translate the metaphor as a simile by using words such as “like” or “as.” It may be enough to to do this in just the first sentence or two.  \n(2) If the target audience would not know the image, find a way of translating it so they can understand what the image is.  \n(3) If the target audience still would not understand, then state it clearly.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n(1) If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, translate the metaphor as a simile by using words such as “like” or “as.” It may be enough to to do this in just the first sentence or two. See Psalm 23:1-2 as an example:<br>\n\n> Yahweh is **my shepherd**; I will lack nothing.  \n> He makes **me** to lie down in green pastures;  \n> **he leads me** beside tranquil water. (ULT)\n\nCan be translated as:\n\n> “Yahweh is **like** a shepherd to me, so I will lack nothing.  \n> **Like** a shepherd who makes his sheep lie down in green pastures and leads them by peaceful waters, Yahweh helps me to rest peacefully.”\n\n(2) If the target audience would not know the image, find a way of translating it so they can understand what the image is.<br>\n\n> My well beloved had a **vineyard** on a very fertile hill.  \n> He **spaded** it, removed the stones, and planted it with **an excellent kind of vine**.  \n> He built **a tower** in the middle of it, and also built a **winepress**.  \n> He waited for it to produce grapes, but it only produced **wild grapes.** (Isaiah 5:1b-2 ULT)\n\nMay be translated as:\n\n> My well beloved had a **grapevine garden** on a very fertile hill.  \n> He **dug up the ground** and removed the stones, and planted it with **the best grapevines**.  \n> He built a **watchtower** in the middle of it, and also built **a tank where he could crush the juice out of the grapes**.  \n> He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced **wild grapes that were not good for making wine**.\n\n(3) If the target audience still would not understand, then state it clearly.\n\n> Yahweh is **my shepherd**; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULT)  \n>  \n> > “Yahweh **cares for me** like a shepherd that cares for his sheep, so I will lack nothing.”  \n>  \n> For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts **is** the house of Israel,  \n> and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;  \n> he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;  \n> for righteousness, but, instead, a shout for help. (Isaiah 5:7 ULT)\n\nCan be translated as:\n\n> > For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts **represents** the house of Israel,  \n> > and the men of Judah **are like** his pleasant planting;  \n> > he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;  \n> > for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help.\n\nor as:\n\n> > **So as** **a farmer stops caring** **for** **a** **grapevine** **garden that produces bad fruit**,  \n> > **Yahweh will stop protecting** Israel and Judah,  \n> > **because they do not do what is right.**  \n> > He waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;  \n> > for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help.  \n",
