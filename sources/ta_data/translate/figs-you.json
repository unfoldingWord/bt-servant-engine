  "text": "### Singular, Dual, and Plural\n\nSome languages have more than one word for “you” based on how many people the word “you” refers to. The **singular** form refers to one person, and the **plural** form refers to more than one person. Some languages also have a **dual** form which refers to two people, and some languages have other forms that refer to three or four people.\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at https://ufw.io/figs_younum.\n\nSometimes in the Bible a speaker uses a singular form of “you” even though he is speaking to a crowd. For help with translating these, we suggest you read:\n\n* [Singular Pronouns that Refer to Groups](../figs-youcrowd/01.md)\n\n### Formal and Informal\n\nSome languages have more than one form of “you” based on the relationship between the speaker and the person he or she is talking to. People use the **formal** form of “you” when speaking to someone who is older, or has higher authority, or is someone they do not know very well. People use the **informal** form when speaking to someone who is not older, or does not have higher authority, or is a family member or close friend.\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at https://ufw.io/figs_youform.\n\nFor help with translating these, we suggest you read:\n\n* [Forms of “You” — Formal or Informal](../figs-youformal/01.md)\n\n### Masculine and Feminine\n\nSome languages have a **masculine** form and a **feminine** form of the word for “you.” People use the **masculine** form when speaking to a man or boy and the **feminine** form when speaking to a woman or girl.\n\nEnglish does not make any of the above distinctions, so they are absent in the ULT. Please be aware of this and use the appropriate forms of “you” if your language does make any of these distinctions.\n",
