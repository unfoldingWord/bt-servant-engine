  "text": "An oath is a solemn promise that someone makes to another person to do something or to solemnly testify that something is true.  The oath includes the idea that a bad thing will happen if the person making the oath does not do the thing promised or if what the person says is not true.\n\n### Description\nThere are two types of oath in the Bible. We can call the first type a “Promise” oath, and the second type a “Truth” oath.\n\n#### Promise Oath\nIn this type of oath, the person saying it is promising to do something. As a guarantee that the person taking the oath will do what he promises, the person calls on God to witness the oath and to punish him severely if he does not do the thing promised. A complete Promise oath has four parts, but some of them are often left unspoken and only implied:\n1. Calling on God to witness the oath and judge the person making it\n2. Making the promise (may be implied as the opposite of the violation)\n3. Telling what would be a violation of the oath (may be implied as the opposite of the promise)\n4. Saying what punishment God would do if the person violates the oath (often implied)\n\n#### Truth Oath\nIn this type of oath, the person saying it is affirming that what he is saying is true, and he guarantees that it is true by naming the life of God. Sometimes the person will not name God directly but will instead name something holy that is associated with God, such as the temple. In some situations, a person might name a revered person, such as a king. The implication is that if the person’s statement proves to be false, that person will lose any relationship to God or to the revered person.\nThese oaths have three parts, but the third part is implied and not stated:\n1. Naming something holy, usually the life of God or of someone who is revered.\n2. Making the statement.\n3. Implied: The speaker and hearers of the oath understand that the speaker forfeits his relationship to God or to the revered person if his statement is false.\n\n#### Reasons This Is a Translation Issue:\n\nPeople in some cultures may not be familiar with the practice of taking oaths, and so they may not understand what the people in the Bible are doing. In many languages, people would not take an oath the way that people did in the Bible, and so they  might not recognize that the person is taking an oath. In the Old Testament, people often did not speak one or more parts of the oath, leaving those parts implied. The part that was most often left unspoken was the part that would tell what would happen if they break the oath. People believed that spoken words have power, and that speaking the part about punishment might cause the punishment to happen, so they often left that part to be understood silently. Because of these things, people might think that the person in the Bible is not making a real oath or they may not understand what the verse is talking about at all.\n\n### Examples From the Bible\n\n#### Promise Oath\n\n> “I raise my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, the possessor of heaven and earth, if from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or if I take from anything that {belongs} to you, so that you will not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ (Genesis 14:22-23 ULT)\n\nIn the verse above, Abram describes a symbolic action (raising his hand to Yahweh) to signal that he is taking an oath and calling on Yahweh as witness and judge. He says what would violate his oath (thus promising to do the opposite). Then he leaves out the part that would describe how Yahweh would punish him if he fails to do what he is promising.\n\n> May Yahweh do thus to me, and thus may he add, if death separates between me and between you. (Ruth 1:17 ULT)\n\nRuth calls on Yahweh and includes the part about Yahweh punishing her, says what the violation would be (thus promising to do the opposite), but does not say what the punishment would be.\n\n> And Saul said, “Thus may God do and thus may he add, for dying you will die, Jonathan.” (1 Samuel 14:44 ULT)\n\nSaul takes an oath that Jonathan will die, but does not specifically say whom God would punish, what the punishment would be, or what the person would do that would violate the oath and bring about God’s punishment.\n\n#### Truth Oath\n\n> But indeed, the life of Yahweh and the life of yourself, that between me and between death is like a step!” (1 Samuel 20:3)<br>\n\nHere David uses a truth oath to convince Jonathan that Saul does indeed want to kill David. David says this because Jonathan had been trying to assure David that he had nothing to fear from Saul. But Jonathan knows that David holds both Yahweh’s and Jonathan’s life as sacred, and so this oath convinces Jonathan that David truly believes what he is saying.\n\n> The life of your soul, my lord, I {am} the woman having stationed herself with you in this {place} to pray to Yahweh. (1 Samuel 1:26 ULT)<br>\n\nHannah is speaking to the priest Eli. She demonstrates that she holds the priest’s life as sacred by swearing by it that what she is saying is true.\n\nAnd Elijah said, “The life of Yahweh of armies, before whom I stand, that I will appear before him today.” (1 Kings 18:15 ULT)\n\nElijah uses this oath to convince Obadiah to announce his arrival to Ahab. Obadiah knows that Elijah would never break his relationship to Yahweh.\n\n#### Combination oath\n\n> The life of Pharaoh, if you leave from this {place} without your youngest brother coming here. (Genesis 42:15)<br>\n\nJoseph is speaking to his brothers as an Egyptian official, and so he swears by the life of Pharaoh rather than by the life of the God of the Hebrews. Joseph combines the two types of oaths here by using a conditional “if” statement (part 3 of the “Promise” oath). He leaves unstated the “then” part of the oath which would be either a punishment from Pharoah (as with a Promise oath) or a breaking of relationship with Pharaoh (as with a “Truth” oath) if this conditional statement proves true.\n\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf people who speak your language would recognize the oath as it is in the ULT, consider translating it in its current form. If not, consider using the following strategies.\n\n(1) Add in the missing parts so that people recognize it as an oath.  \n(2) If oaths are unfamiliar, add a short explanation of what an oath is.  \n(3) Put the oath into a form that would be natural in your language.<br>\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n(1) Add in the missing parts so that people recognize it as an oath.\n\n> “I raise my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, the possessor of heaven and earth, if from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or if I take from anything that {belongs} to you, so that you will not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ (Genesis 14:22-23 ULT)\n\n“I raise my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, the possessor of heaven and earth, **and ask him to punish me severely** if from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or if I take from anything that {belongs} to you, so that you will not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’\n\n> And Saul said, “Thus may God do and thus may he add, for dying you will die, Jonathan.” (1 Samuel 14:44 ULT)\n\nAnd Saul said, “May God **punish me severely** and may he add **even more punishment if I do not kill you**, for dying you will die, Jonathan.”\n\n> But indeed, the life of Yahweh and the life of yourself, that between me and between death is like a step! (1 Samuel 20:3)\n\nBut indeed, **I swear by** Yahweh’s life and **by** the life of yourself that **it is true that** between me and death is like a step!\n\n> The life of Pharaoh, if you leave from this {place} without your youngest brother coming here. (Genesis 42:15)\n\n**I swear by** the life of Pharaoh, if you leave from this {place} without your youngest brother coming here, **may Pharaoh punish me severely**.\n\n(2) If oaths are unfamiliar, add a short explanation of what an oath is.\n\n> May Yahweh do thus to me, and thus may he add, if death separates between me and between you. (Ruth 1:17 ULT)\n\n**Then Ruth called on Yahweh to enforce her promise:** “May Yahweh do thus to me, and thus may he add, if death separates between me and between you.”\n\n> But indeed, the life of Yahweh and the life of yourself, that between me and between death is like a step! (1 Samuel 20:3)\n\n**Then David made a statement to Jonathan to convince him that he truly believed that he was in danger:** “But indeed, **I forfeit my relationship to** Yahweh and **to you** yourself **if it is not true** that between me and death is like a step!”\n\n(3) Put the oath into a form that would be natural in your language.\n\n> “I raise my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, the possessor of heaven and earth, if from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or if I take from anything that {belongs} to you, so that you will not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ (Genesis 14:22-23 ULT)\n\n“**I solemnly swear before** Yahweh, God Most High, the possessor of heaven and earth, **that I will not take** from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or from anything that {belongs} to you, **so help me God**, so that you will not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’\n\n> May Yahweh do thus to me, and thus may he add, if death separates between me and between you. (Ruth 1:17 ULT)\n\nMay Yahweh **strike me dead right where I stand** if death separates between me and between you.\n\n> But indeed, the life of Yahweh and the life of yourself, that between me and between death is like a step! (1 Samuel 20:3)\n\nBut indeed, **before** Yahweh and **before you** yourself, **I swear** that between me and death is like a step!",
