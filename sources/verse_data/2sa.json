        "note": "The author seems to be describing two different groups of three warriors. The ULT distinguishes between them by treating the word **Three** as a title (uppercase) when it describes the great warriors of the first rank, Josheb Basshebeth, Eleazar, and Shammah ([23:8–12](../23/08.md)), and by treating the word **three** as a description (lowercase) when it describes the great warriors of the second rank, Abishai, Benaiah, and another unnamed warrior ([23:13–23](../23/13.md)). Your language may have a convention of its own that you could use to distinguish between these groups, or you could use descriptive phrases, as the UST does. Some versions express the interpretation that Abishai was the commander of the Three, that is, the great warriors of the first rank. Other versions follow some ancient manuscripts and say that Abishai was the commander of the Thirty, the warriors listed in [23:24–39](../23/24.md).
