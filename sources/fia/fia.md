# The 6 FIA steps of drafting

## INTRODUCTION
Creating a translation draft is like making good food (like a cake). To make a good meal, you need to have certain ingredients (to make a cake, you just need flour, eggs, and sugar). In the same way, we need some basic ingredients to make a good translation draft. We call these ingredients  familiarization,  internalization, and articulation,  or  "FIA."
- Familiarization  helps a translation team know everything  in a passage very well (if appropriate, touch your head here).
- Internalization  helps the team move that knowledge  to their heart so they understand the passage deeply (if appropriate, touch your heart here).
- Articulation  helps the translation team begin to decide  how to translate a passage and practice expressing the passage in their own language (if appropriate, spread out your hands here).

Making good food also requires you to do certain things and follow a certain process. In the same way, the FIA steps have teams do specific activities and follow a specific process to create a translation draft. The activities and steps in the FIA process help make sure that the translation team:
- Has all the information they need to know in order to translate that passage of scripture.
- Deeply understands a passage of scripture so they can translate it well.
- Has lots of practice in expressing the passage in their language
	
	
## FIA Step #1:  Head and Heart
In this step, the idea is to hear the pass and put the passage in one's heart. Translators will watch or list the passage in a language of wider communication and in as many translations as they can. Then they will discuss the passage.

First, listen to an audio version of the passage three times, in three different translations, if possible. Then, as a group, discuss the following questions. 
1. What do you like in this passage?
2. What do you not like or not understand in this passage?
3. What does this passage tell us about Jesus?
4. What does this passage tell us about people?
5. How does this passage affect our daily lives?
6. Whho do you know who needs to hear this passage?

## FIA Step #2:  Setting the Stage
In this step, translators will listen or watch the whole context of a passage. This context might be historical, cultural, linguistic, or geographical. Here, the translation team might look at pictures and maps to help them understand the context of the passage. The team will discuss some of that context as a group and talk about how that context relates to their own culture.

## FIA Step #3:  Defining the Scenes
In this step the translators will hear about the different scenes and characters in a passage. They will visualize the scenes by drawing, storyboarding, or using random objects to show the different scenes and action in the passage.

## FIA Step #4:  Embodying the Text
In this step, the translators act out the story two times. The first time, they act out the story without stopping. The second time, they stop at different points in the story and discuss what different characters might be feeling or thinking in the story.

## FIA Step #5:  Filling the Gaps
In this step the translators focus on the specific words and key terms in the story. They discuss how they say things in their language, and begin to choose how they translate certain words and phrases.

## FIA Step #6:  Signing or Speaking the Word
In this step the translation team will practice signing or speaking the passage. As a group, they will talk about the different words and phrases they will use  when they create a draft of the passage.
