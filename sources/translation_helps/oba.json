Here also Yahweh describes how he will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. There are two possibilities for how you can make this explicit, If it would be helpful in your language. Choosing between these possibilities depends on how you interpret the referent of the word **you**. The word **you** here is masculine plural, the first and only time it occurs in this form in the book. Throughout the book, the nation of Edom was addressed with the masculine singular form. This is also the last occurrence of the second person in the book. (1) Because of these observations, the use of drinking here and throughout the Bible as a metaphor for suffering punishment, and the location of this suffering on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, it seems that here Obadiah stops addressing the people of Edom and returns to addressing the people of Israel. At the beginning of the book, Obadiah included the people of Israel when he said, “We have heard a report from Yahweh.” Now, near the end of the book, he addresses them again, giving them assurance that the people of Edom will be punished for what they did to the people of Israel.

Here, however, **you** is masculine plural. There are two possibilities for who is being addressed here. (1) It refers to the people of Israel. This would explain the shift from singular to plural. Just as Obadiah addressed the people of Israel in the plural in [1:1](../01/01.md), so he addresses them in the plural now. This interpretation also fits with the metaphor used here and throughout the Bible that pictures suffering and divine punishment as drinking something that makes a person stagger, fall, and die. The people of Israel suffered and died in Jerusalem when the city was destroyed. This also allows the comparison in this verse to fit with the idea in the previous verse that Edom will suffer in the same way that they made Israel to suffer. See the UST. (2) It refers to the people of Edom. In this case, the comparison is between how the people of Edom literally drank wine in celebration of Jerusalem’s destruction with how the nations will metaphorically drink God’s punishment. Either that, or the verb must be forced into a future meaning, and the comparison is between how God will punish the people of Edom in Jerusalem and how God will punish all the nations.

        "note": "Even though **the mountain of Zion** is a figurative name for Jerusalem, it would be good to keep the imagery of this high place in Jerusalem where God’s temple was, if possible. This would also allow the comparison with **the mountain of Esau**. Edom had boasted that it was up high and that no one could bring it down. But with this figurative imagery, Yahweh is saying that he will bring it down and place his own people up high instead. you could also choose to express this meaning in plain language if that is how you have been translating the book and if **the mountain of Zion** would be misunderstood. Alternate translation: [Israel’s saviors will go up to Jerusalem and will rule over Edom, who thought that they were so high, from up there]"
