        "note": "Here, **house** represents a people group, the Israelites, who were descended from Jacob, who was also named Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a metaphor from your language or translate the meaning. This is a common biblical metaphor, so you may want to check other places this occurs. The **house of Israel** is equivalent to “sons of Israel” or “Israelites.”"
