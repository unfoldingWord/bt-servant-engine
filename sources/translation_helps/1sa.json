Saul’s different requirement of **a hundred foreskins of Philistines** had both practical and symbolic significance. Since Israelite men were circumcised but Philistine men were not, this requirement ensured that David could not bring back the heads of slain Israelites and claim they were Philistines. Beyond that, as [14:6](../14/06.md), [17:26](../17/26.md), and [17:36](../17/36.md) show, Israelites used the word “uncircumcised” as a derogatory term indicating that the Philistines did not worship Yahweh and did not obey his laws. So bringing back their foreskins as war trophies would symbolically show that Saul was being **avenged** on these **enemies** who were also hostile to Yahweh. (Saul tells David in [18:17](../18/17.md) that he is sending him out to fight “the battles of Yahweh.”) Alternate translation: [except that you kill a hundred Philistines and bring back their foreskins to prove that it was indeed these uncircumcised heathen whom you killed]"
