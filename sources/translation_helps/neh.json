They may have sprinkled themselves, the people, the gates, and the walls with water or with blood, or they may have offered sacrifices. But while the details are uncertain, the purpose of the ceremony is clear. It was to show that the Israelites wanted this place and everyone in it to be acceptable to God. So while it might be best not to suggest how the priests and Levites performed this ceremony, since that is unknown, you could say explicitly what the purpose was if that would be helpful to your readers.

He did not hold a ceremony of purification, since the priests and Levites themselves would have done that. Rather, he means that he made sure that none of the other priests or Levites were married to foreign women, and that in this way he ensured that the priesthood was no longer unclean, as described in [13:29](../13/29.md).
