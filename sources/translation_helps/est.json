(As we learn in [2:21](../02/21.md), some of these officials also protected the king’s private quarters.) As we see here, and as will also be seen in [2:14](../02/14.md) and [2:16](../02/16.md), their duties included escorting women from place to place. The term likely indicates that, in keeping with the practices of the time, these men were castrated because their work brought them into such close contact with the king’s wives and concubines. If your language has a term for such an official and you think your readers would recognize it, you could use it.
