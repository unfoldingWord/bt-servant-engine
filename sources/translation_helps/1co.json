        "note": "Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to Christ, identifies Paul’s **love** as something that he does because both he and the Corinthians are united to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: [in our union with the Lord] or [as fellow believers]"

Consider whether translations your readers might be familiar with include **Amen** here or not. If there is no strong reason to choose one option over the other, you could follow the ULT."

If your readers would not know what **Amen** means, you could also explain its meaning. Alternate translation: [Amen, which means, “So be it!”]"
