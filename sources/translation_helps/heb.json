See the book introduction for more discussion of these issues. Here, the phrase could refer to believers who: (1) used to live in **Italy** but now live somewhere else. This fits with the idea that the author sent this letter to Rome, which is in Italy. The people who used to live in **Italy** are greeting their friends back home.
